### Start

This guide starts on Day 79, when you find the cassette of Ned Goodwin.
I recommend, that you check out the whole guide first.

### Which way to go?

Running using the letter "R" is faster and, I'm afraid, the only way to get to the cable car in time.
There won't be much time to look at the map, for that reason have a look at this map. This is the path you are going to take. **Also be sure to clear the shortcut shown in the third image.**

Head straight to the lake. **Don't go to the Ned's Goodwin's bunker. The story will continue normally.**

Continue running to the lake, in between the rocks.

Here I found this shortcut on the right, be sure to take it so you get some extra time.

In the canyon go mainly in the river. Somewhere in the middle of the canyon is a part where the river goes under a rock, although you can head straight - to the only rock you are going to climb in the canyon.

Just note, that animations are slower than running on your own. Therefore remember to run around this tree log.

Just head straight.

You can actually go off path for a moment, to a log, that you can jump over.

Head straight, you can keep the center phone cable pole as your navigation. On then forward it's simple, just run as usual.

And here you are, with Delilah still clearly talking with you. Hope you did it in time.

Conversation
As you may or may not know, different choices of your answers will affect the duration of the conversation. That's why I calculated the best choices.

The best choices are:
- After the cassette don't start the conversation and don't answer at all.

- "Ned loved him."

- "It'll be okay."

- "What if they don't come back?"

Answer at the last moment.

### Another ending?

It's insane to even think, that this popular game from year 2016 has an ending nobody ever saw, right? Is there really another ending achieved using this technique?

I highly recommend you to try this on your own. Besides for the reason, that this game is beautiful and worth another replay.

**For those of you who can't wait, check below.**

### Final Thoughts

Sadly, there isn't another ending, not even something extra. I think, that developers didn't even think this was possible! Even though I didn't find anything new, I find this as success. I proved what I wanted, it is possible!
