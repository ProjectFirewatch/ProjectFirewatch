## Introduction

After you beat the main story of Firewatch, you may stumble upon Firewatch's Free Roam gamemode (only available after beating the main story). Inside this gamemode, you roam the map as you wish. Along the way you may notice cassettes hidden away in random places. Each cassette contains certain tracks from the game's soundtrack. This guide will show you the location of every single cassette within Firewatch's Free Roam gamemode.

You will be using the wave receiver to find the cassette. The wave receiver itself is found in Cache 306. This cache will also contain a map with coordinates. The signals the wave receiver gives will help you find the cassettes if you need a bit of extra help. It is pictured below:

## First Cassette

- This cassette is the one you find within the Two Forks Lookout Tower. It is fairly easy to find, and it contains tracks 1 - 4. You were probably rushing through the game if you missed this one.

## Second Cassette

- This cassette contains tracks 5 - 8. It is located near Beartooth Point in the field before you reach the peak of the overlook. It will be hidden behind some overgrowth which requires the axe to be cleared.

## Third Cassette

- This cassette contains tracks 9 - 12. It is near the Jonesy Lake, specifically by the point you find the naked teenage girls partying in the campaign. You will find it across the log and up the rocks. This one is a bit harder to locate so be sure to use your Wave Receiver.

## Fourth Cassette

- The fourth cassette contains tracks 13 - 16. It is quite a bit harder to find and took me nearly an hour to find myself (which is why the screenshot is during the night). You will find in the Cottonwood Creek past the large tree marking the entrance. It will be laying upon a nearby rock.

## Fifth Cassette

- This is the final cassette and it contains tracks 17 - 20. It is located near the Two Forks lookout, past some fallen fences.The fallen fences lead to a trail called Thorofare Trail. Continue onwards down this trail and you'll eventually reach a bunch of rocks blocking the way. The cassette will be located infront of the impassable rocks.
